## Synopsis

A program that runs on your pi in the background to monitor the basic "health" outputs of your pi. 

It will send alerts if certain limitations are reached allowing you to shutdown the process and/or solve it remotely.


## Motivation

A few months ago, I was messing around with my R-Pi.  While it was running a script, I walked away for 30 min. to 
make some dinner.  To my surprise, when I came back the pi was off.  "Huh, thats odd." I thought i wrote a solid 
script. So it shouldn't have shut anything off automatically.  
 
Naturally, I tried to restart it.  No luck. Couldnt get anything to boot up.  
I touch the board, and  nearly threw it to the ceiling. Incredibly hot!
     
Well... I fried it while I was frying chicken.  
 
So here is this project.  An attempt at averting this problem again.
